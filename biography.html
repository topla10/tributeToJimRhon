          <h3>His Early life</h3>
          <p>
            Emanuel James Rohn was born at Yakima, Washington, to Emmanuel and
            Clara Rohn. His parents owned and worked a farm in Caldwell, Idaho,
            where Rohn grew up as an only child. He was born to a poor family,
            became a millionaire at age 30, and went broke when he was 33. He
            later became a millionaire again. Rohn left college after one year

        <article id="career">
          <h3>Career</h3>
          <p>
            He started his professional life as a human resource manager for
            Sears. Around this time, a friend invited him to a lecture given by
            entrepreneur John Earl Shoaff. In 1955, Rohn joined Shoaff's direct
            selling business, AbundaVita, as a distributor.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1957, Rohn resigned his distributorship with AbundaVita and
            joined Nutri-Bio, another direct selling company. The company's
            founders, including Shoaff, started to mentor him. After this
            mentorship, Rohn built one of the largest organizations in the
            company. In 1960, when Nutri-Bio expanded into Canada, Shoaff and
            the other founders put Rohn in charge of the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Nutri-Bio went out of business in the early 1960s, Rohn was
            invited to speak at his Rotary Club. He accepted, and soon, others
            began asking him to speak at various luncheons and other events. In
            1963, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, he gave his first public seminar.
            He then began presenting seminars across the country, telling his
            story and teaching his personal development philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the 1970s, Rohn conducted seminars for Standard Oil. At
            the same time, he participated in a personal development business
            called Adventures in Achievement, which featured live seminars and
            personal development workshops. He presented seminars worldwide for
            more than 40 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rohn mentored Mark R. Hughes (the founder of Herbalife
            International) and life strategist Tony Robbins in the late 1970s.
            Others who credit Rohn for influencing their careers include
            authors/lecturers Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield (Chicken Soup
            book series), Everton Edwards (Hallmark Innovators Conglomerate),
            Brian Tracy, Darren Hardy, Todd Smith, Kevin Garver, Sir-lim Kush
            from Nairobi Kenya isamtec solutions and T. Harv Eker. Rohn
            coauthored the novel Twelve Pillars with Chris Widener.[
          </p>
          <p>
            Rohn was the recipient of the 1985 National Speakers Association
            CPAE Award for excellence in speaking. He was the author of 17
            written, audio, and video media, including The Power of Ambition,
            Take Charge of Your Life, and The Day That Turns Your Life Around.
            Many of his speeches are available for free on social media
            platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Instagram

          <h3>A National Treasure</h3>
          <p>
            For more than 40 years, Jim Rohn honed his craft like a skilled
            artist—helping people the world over sculpt life strategies that
            expanded their imagination of what is possible. Those who had the
            privilege of hearing him speak can attest to the elegance and common
            sense of his material. It is no coincidence, then, that he is still
            widely regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of our time,
            and thought of by many as a national treasure. He authored countless
            books and audio and video programs, and helped motivate and shape an
            entire generation of personal-development trainers and hundreds of
            executives from America’s top corporations.

          <h3>Idaho Farm Boy Makes It</h3>
          <p>
            Born to an Idaho farming family in the mid-1900s, Jim was ingrained
            with a work ethic that served him well throughout his life. At 25,
            he met his mentor Earl Shoaff. And over the next six years he made
            his first fortune, yet didn’t get into speaking until he moved to
            Beverly Hills, Calif., when a friend at the Rotary Club asked him to
            tell his success story, which Rohn titled “Idaho Farm Boy Makes It
            to Beverly Hills.” His speech went over so well that he received
            more invitations to share it, and better yet, they started paying
            him for it. In the beginning, he spoke in front of college and
            high-school classes and at service clubs, before moving on to
            seminars in 1963, which launched him into the personal-development
            business. From then on, he became a trailblazer in the
            self-help/personal-development industry, impacting the lives of
            millions through his life-changing material.
