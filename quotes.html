        <div class="quote one">
          <blockquote>
            Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don't wish for less
            problems, wish for more skills. Don't wish for less challenge, wish
            for more wisdom.
          </blockquote>

        <div class="quote second">
          <q>
            Learn how to be happy with what you have while you pursue all that
            you want.
          </q</>
        </div>
        
        <div class="quote fourth">
          <blockquote>
            We must all wage an intense, lifelong battle against the constant
            downward pull. If we relax, the bugs and weeds of negativity will
            move into the garden and take away everything of value.
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="quote fifth">
          <q>
            If you really want to do something, you’ll find a way. If you don’t,
            you’ll find an excuse.
          </q>
        </div>
        <div class="quote sixth">
          <blockquote>
            Motivation alone is not enough. If you have an idiot and you
            motivate him, now you have a motivated idiot.
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        
        <div class="quote eighth">
          <q>
            Don’t just read the easy stuff. You may be entertained by it, but
            you will never grow from it.
          </q>
        </div>
        <div class="quote ninth">
          <blockquote>
            Life and business is like the changing seasons. You cannot change
            the seasons, but you can change yourself. Therein lies the
            opportunity to live an extraordinary life–the opportunity to change
            yourself.

        <div class="quote third">
            <q>
              Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced
              every day.
            </q>
          </div>
        <div class="quote tenth">
          <blockquote>
            Days are expensive. When you spend a day you have one less day to
            spend. So make sure you spend each one wisely.

              Work harder on yourself than you do on your job.
